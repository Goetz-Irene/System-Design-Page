        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Irene Goetz, and I am a student at Central Washington University. This quarter, I had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of digital information environments through an engaging course. It was an eye-opening experience that encouraged me to view digital environments not just as abstract tools, but as spaces much like a coffee shop or library—places where people interact, engage, and navigate information.</p>
        <p>Throughout the course, I explored various aspects of systems engineering, UX design, the ethics of information sharing, and even podcast design. This static web page serves as my final project for the course, showcasing the key concepts I’ve learned and how I’ve applied them to a digital platform.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the insights shared here as fascinating as I have found exploring them!</p>
